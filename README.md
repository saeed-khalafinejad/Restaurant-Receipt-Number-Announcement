# Number Announcement Software in Restaurants for the Farsi Language
The Delphi application published here is used in restaurant POS (point of sale) systems to notify the customers that their food is ready. This application is developed by Saeed Khalafinejad from Kasabeh Group and is used in [Kasabeh Restaurant Accounting Software](https://kasabeh.org/resIntro.html) (Kasabeh means businessmen in Farsi).  The application announces the bill number via the POS speaker and hence  removes the need to buy an extra device for notifying the customers. Some notes about this application:
* The application announces numbers in the Farsi language.
* Software engineering concepts such as Queue and Mutex are used in this application in order to announce several numbers one after the other seamlessly.
* It uses high quality voice files that lead to clear and concise announcement.
* The announcement application is a very small part of our [Kasabeh Restaurant Accounting Software](https://kasabeh.org/resIntro.html).
